# **Othello Project**

A modern C++ implementation of the classic board game "Othello" (also known as "Reversi").  
This project was developed to showcase the power and efficiency of C++ in creating intricate game mechanics, user interactions, and state management. It serves as a demonstration of how C++ can be utilized for complex game development.

## **Features:**
* Interactive Console-Based Board: Use commands to place your piece and watch as the game logic determines which opponent pieces to flip.
* State Management: Efficiently keep track of player scores and game state using C++ data structures.
* Optimized Game Logic: Utilizes advanced C++ algorithms and techniques for fast and responsive gameplay.
* Save & Load: Capability to save game progress to a file and load it later.

## **How to Play:**
1. Start by entering the coordinates to place your piece on the board.
2. The game will automatically determine which opponent pieces to flip based on the rules of Othello.
3. The player with the most pieces on the board at the end wins
